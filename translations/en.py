    # --- help: states ---
    "Plant States": "Plant States",
    "Help state Sown detailed": "The 'Sown' state means the seed has been placed in a substrate like soil or moist cotton in hopes it will germinate.",
    "Help state Soaking detailed": "Soaking is often used to soften hard seed coats before sowing. It can last from a few hours to several days.",
    "Help state Stratifying detailed": "Cold stratification mimics winter: some seeds need a period of cold and moisture to break dormancy. This is often done in a refrigerator.",
    "Help state Growing detailed": "Once the seed has germinated and a seedling begins to grow, the plant enters the growth stage, producing its first true leaves.",
    "Help state Flowering detailed": "The plant has started flowering. This is a key stage for species grown for their flowers or fruit.",
    "Help state Fruiting detailed": "The plant is bearing fruit, indicating successful pollination after flowering.",
    "Help state Dead detailed": "The 'Dead' state means the plant has died or no growth has been observed for a long time.",

    # --- help: events ---
    "Plant Events": "Plant Events",
    "Help event Sow detailed": "Log the moment you sow a seed. You can also estimate how long it will take to germinate (minimum and maximum duration).",
    "Help event Soak detailed": "Record the start of soaking. This is useful for species that germinate better after prolonged contact with water.",
    "Help event Strat detailed": "Indicate when stratification begins. You can specify the expected duration (e.g. 6 weeks at 4°C).",
    "Help event Plant detailed": "Use this event to note when a seedling or cutting is planted into a pot or the ground.",
    "Help event Sprout detailed": "Note when germination is observed—when the root or shoot emerges.",
    "Help event Flower detailed": "Log when the first visible flowers appear.",
    "Help event Fruit detailed": "Add an event when fruits start forming on the plant.",
    "Help event Measurement detailed": "Used to log the current size of the plant (in cm, mm, or m).",
    "Help event Custom Event detailed": "A free-form event you can name and describe, such as 'Repotting', 'Disease', etc.",
    "Help event Death detailed": "Marks that the plant has died (wilted, rotted, dried out…).",

    # --- help: transitions ---
    "How States Change": "How States Change",
    "Help transitions description detailed": "Each event can cause a change in the plant's state. Here's how it works:",
    "Help transition Sow detailed": "After sowing, the plant enters the 'Sown' state.",
    "Help transition Soak detailed": "Soaking puts the seed into the 'Soaking' state.",
    "Help transition Strat detailed": "Stratification sets the seed to the 'Stratifying' state.",
    "Help transition Plant detailed": "The 'Plant' event sets the plant to 'Growing'.",
    "Help transition Sprout detailed": "Germination moves the plant into the 'Growing' state.",
    "Help transition Flower detailed": "The start of flowering is recorded, the plant remains in the 'Growing' state.",
    "Help transition Fruit detailed": "The appearance of fruits is noted, the plant stays in the 'Growing' state.",
    "Help transition Measurement detailed": "A measurement doesn’t change the plant’s state.",
    "Help transition Custom Event detailed": "Custom events do not change the state.",
    "Help transition Death detailed": "The plant transitions to the 'Dead' state.",
